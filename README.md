A ready-to-use asset pack featuring 168 beautifully formatted flags named after their respective ISO currency codes! No
more guessing, no more manual renaming—just plug and play! 🚀

## 📌 Why This Exists

Have you ever found yourself thinking:

> "If only the assets are all formatted with the currency code and I can just programmatically populate them, is it too
> much to ask?"

Well, not anymore! This pack gives you properly formatted flag assets using the `ic_flag_{currency_code}` convention, so
you can drop them straight into your project without extra work.

```
